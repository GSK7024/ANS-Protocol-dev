## When to Hold Meetings

- **Full Team Meeting**: Major features, architecture changes, new integrations
- **Quick Standup**: Bug fixes, minor UI changes, small improvements
- **Emergency Huddle**: Critical bugs, security issues

---

## Founder Updates

The Founder trusts the team. Only notify them:
- After significant milestones are COMPLETED
- When facing a TRUE BLOCKER that can't be resolved
- For critical decisions that could impact the business direction

**DO NOT ask for approval before every action. The CEO makes decisions and executes.**
